abstract = {Blood products are essential components of any healthcare system, and their safety, in terms of being free of transfusion-transmittable infections, is crucial. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States requires all blood donations to be tested for certain infection types, it does not dictate which particular tests should be used by blood centers. Multiple FDA-licensed blood screening tests are available for each infection type, and screening tests are imperfectly reliable and have different costs. In addition, infection prevalence rates within the donor population are uncertain for both emerging and established infection types. In this setting, the budget-constrained blood center's objective is to devise a "robust" postdonation bloodscreening scheme that minimizes the risk of an infectious donation being released into the blood supply. Toward this goal, we study the minimization of the transfusion-transmittable infection risk considering regret-and expectation-based objectives, and we characterize structural properties of their optimal solutions. This allows us to gain insight, derive the price of robustness, and develop efficient algorithms. The proposed robust solution lowers the expected infection risk over various FDA-compliant testing schemes as well as the expectation-based scheme under forecast error. These findings have important public policy implications.},

abstract = {The safety and integrity of the blood supply is of paramount importance for delivering optimal medical care. Additionally, blood safety is of utmost importance to the United States public. Pathogen testing of donated blood products has been adapted and developed with the goal of eliminating the risk of transfusion-transmitted infectious disease. Currently, blood safety interventions are focused on excluding persons at risk for transfusion-transmissible infections from donating blood and on detecting the presence of transfusion-transmissible agents in donated blood. These interventions are intended to be complementary and function to isolate, and ideally, eliminate, the risk of exposure to known pathogenic agents by transfused blood components. We provide an overview of the strategies and techniques utilized to ensure the safety of the blood supply in the U.S.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of viral infection associated with blood transfusion is lower than ever before because of aggressive screening and testing practices. NAT technology has lowered that risk even further but at an additional cost to the health-care system. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Marginal cost-effectiveness of NAT for HIV, HCV, and HBV in whole-blood donations was calculated with a previously published Markov decision model. This model was updated with disease incidence data from all 2001 American Red Cross whole-blood donations as well as window-period data from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS). RESULTS: Whole-blood donation NAT for HIV and HCV is expected to cost between 155 US dollars million (minipool NAT) and 428 million US dollars(single-donation NAT) per year in the US and avert 4 to 7 HIV infections and 56 to 59 HCV infections. Adding HBV NAT would be expected to avert 9 to 37 HBV infections at an additional cost of between 39 million US dollars and 130 million US dollars per year. Overall, NAT would cost between 4.7 million US dollars and 11.2 million US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Discontinuing HIV p24 antigen and HBc testing would offset this somewhat. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of whole-blood NAT is poor. The testing cost would need to decrease significantly to bring the cost-effectiveness in line with most other accepted medical practices.},

This review summarizes the clinical evidence available for licensed component PI technologies and red cell PI under development. Materials and Methods Available literature on licensed technologies was reviewed. Results For the plasma and platelets technologies available, evidence for the inactivation of most pathogens is good, except for certain nonenveloped viruses. Clinical trials and haemovigilance programmes suggest the observed loss of potency is of little clinical significance, with some technology-specific exceptions. Concerns over adverse toxicological effects or neoantigen formation have not been confirmed for currently licensed products. Conclusion While platelet PI has been adopted to reduce bacterial contamination, the ability of PI methods to replace testing for emerging bloodborne infections, or as a substitute for selective pathogen testing, gamma-irradiation or even leucodepletion, make adoption of PI for components increasingly attractive. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society of Blood Transfusion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of adding nucleic acid testing (NAT) to serological (antibody and antigen) screening protocols for donated blood in the United States (US) with the purpose of reducing the risks of transfusion-transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The costs, health consequences and cost-effectiveness of adding either minipool or individual-donor NAT to serological screening (SS) testing were estimated using a decision-analysis model. RESULTS: With the given modelling assumptions, adding minipool NAT would avoid an estimated 37, 128 and eight cases of HBV, HCV and HIV, respectively, and save approximately 53 additional years of life and 102 additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SS, at a net cost of {\$}154 million. SS + minipool NAT - p24 compared with SS alone resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of {\$}1.5 million per QALY gained (range in sensitivity analysis {\$}1.0-2.1 million per QALY gained) in this US analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of adding NAT screening is outside the typical range for most healthcare interventions, but not for established blood safety measures.},

abstract = {Since the 1970s, introduction of serological assays targeting virus-specific antibodies and antigens has been effective in identifying blood donations infected with the classic transfusion-transmitted infectious agents (TTIs; hepatitis B virus [HBV], HIV, human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II, hepatitis C virus [HCV]). Subsequently, progressive implementation of nucleic acid–amplification technology (NAT) screening for HIV, HCV, and HBV has reduced the residual risk of infectious-window-period donations, such that per unit risks are {\textless}1 in 1 000 000 in the United States, other high-income countries, and in high-incidence regions performing NAT. NAT screening has emerged as the preferred option for detection of newer TTIs including West Nile virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), and Babesia microti. Although there is continual need to monitor current risks due to established TTI, ongoing challenges in blood safety relate primarily to surveillance for emerging agents coupled with development of rapid response mechanisms when such agents are identified. Recent progress in development and implementation of pathogen-reduction technologies (PRTs) provide the opportunity for proactive rather than reactive response to blood-safety threats. Risk-based decision-making tools and cost-effectiveness models have proved useful to quantify infectious risks and place new interventions in context. However, as evidenced by the 2015 to 2017 ZIKV pandemic, a level of tolerable risk has yet to be defined in such a way that conflicting factors (eg, theoretical recipient risk, blood availability, cost, and commercial interests) can be reconciled. A unified approach to TTIs is needed, whereby novel tests and PRTs replace, rather than add to, existing interventions, thereby ameliorating cost and logistical burden to blood centers and hospitals.},

abstract = {Blood products, derived from donated blood, are essential for many medical treatments, and their safety, in terms of being free of Transfusion-Transmitted Infections (TTIs)-i.e., infectious agents that can be spread through their use-is crucial. However, blood screening tests are not perfectly reliable and may produce false negative or false-positive results. Currently, blood donations are tested using a same-for-all testing scheme, where a single test set is used on all blood donations. This article studies differential testing schemes, which may involve multiple test sets, each applied to a randomly selected fraction of the donated blood. Thus, although each blood donation is still tested by a single test set, multiple test sets may be used by the Blood Center. This problem is modeled within an optimization framework and a novel solution methodology is provided that allows important structural properties of such testing schemes to be characterized. It is shown that an optimal differential testing scheme consists of at most two test sets, and such a dual-test scheme can significantly reduce the TTI risk over the current same-for-all testing. The presented analysis leads to an efficient greedy algorithm that generates the optimal differential test sets for a range of budgets to inform the decision-maker (e.g., Blood Center). The differential model is extended to the case where different test sets can be used on subsets of donations defined by donation characteristics (e.g., donor demographics, seasonality, or region) that differentiate the sub-set's TTI prevalence rates. The risk reduction potential of differential testing is quantified through two case studies that use published data from Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. The study generates key insight into public policy decision making on the design of blood screening schemes.},

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT in the first year of screening compared with alternatives for the 50 states and separately for Puerto Rico. Design: Microsimulation that captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients, sexual partners, and their infants. Data Sources: National testing results compiled by AABB and costs, utilities, and outcome probabilities estimated from the literature. Target Population: Transfusion recipients. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Universal ID-NAT, universal mini-pool NAT (MP-NAT), and ID-NAT exclusively for components transfused to women of childbearing age. Seasonally targeted strategies in Puerto Rico and geographically targeted strategies in the 50 states were also considered. Outcome Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and outcomes. Results of Base-Case Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT exclusively during high mosquito season was cost-effective at {\$}81 123 per QALY (95{\%} CI, {\$}49 138 to {\$}978 242 per QALY).

Results of Sensitivity Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT only during the season of high mosquito activity was most cost-effective in 64{\%} of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations. In the 50 states, no intervention was cost-effective in 99.99{\%} of iterations. Cost-effectiveness was highly dependent on the rate of assumed infectious donations. Limitation: Data were limited on the component-specific trans-missibility of Zika and long-term sequelae of infection. Conclusion: Screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico, and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. During periods with lower rates of Zika-infectious donations, the cost-effectiveness of screening will be even less favorable. Primary Funding Source: None.},

abstract = {Background: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a rare, progressive fatal noninflammatory neurodegenerative disease. Ireland has the second highest rate of vCJD in the world with an ongoing risk of vCJD transmission through blood transfusion. Prion-removing filters have been developed to reduce the risk of vCJD transmission. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a policy of prion filtration of red blood cells (RBCs) in the Republic of Ireland. Study design and methods: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to simulate the likelihood of RBC recipients developing clinical vCJD as a result of being transfused with infected RBCs. Model variables were collected from published literature and expert opinion. Costs were estimated based on the processing changes required to implement prion filtration. Results: In the absence of prion filtration, it is estimated that two individuals will develop clinical vCJD arising from RBC transfusions over a 10-year time horizon. The discounted life-years lost will be 18.5 years. With prion filtration, there will be no deaths or life-years lost. The discounted cost of universal prion filtration is {\^{a}}68.2 million over 10 years with a corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of {\^{a}}3.7 million per life-year gained. In 25.3{\%} of simulations there were no deaths from vCJD infection through infected blood transfusions, irrespective of prion filtration. Conclusion: Prion filtration is considered not cost-effective by traditional measures. Although numerous non-cost-effective blood safety strategies have been implemented in the past, consideration should be given to the most efficient use of finite resources in transfusion medicine. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Association of Blood Banks.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Since its introduction in North America in 1999, West Nile virus has produced the 3 largest arboviral neuroinvasive disease outbreaks ever recorded in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To review the ecology, virology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, prevention, and control of West Nile virus, with an emphasis on North America. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed electronic database was searched through February 5, 2013. United States national surveillance data were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. FINDINGS: West Nile virus is now endemic throughout the contiguous United States, with 16 196 human neuroinvasive disease cases and 1549 deaths reported since 1999. More than 780 000 illnesses have likely occurred. To date, incidence is highest in the Midwest from mid-July to early September. West Nile fever develops in approximately 25{\%} of those infected, varies greatly in clinical severity, and symptoms may be prolonged. Neuroinvasive disease (meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis) develops in less than 1{\%} but carries a fatality rate of approximately 10{\%}. Encephalitis has a highly variable clinical course but often is associated with considerable long-term morbidity. Approximately two-thirds of those with paralysis remain with significant weakness in affected limbs. Diagnosis usually rests on detection of IgM antibody in serum or cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment is supportive; no licensed human vaccine exists. Prevention uses an integrated pest management approach, which focuses on surveillance, elimination of mosquito breeding sites, and larval and adult mosquito management using pesticides to keep mosquito populations low. During outbreaks or impending outbreaks, emphasis shifts to aggressive adult mosquito control to reduce the abundance of infected, biting mosquitoes. Pesticide exposure and adverse human health events following adult mosquito control operations for West Nile virus appear negligible. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In North America, West Nile virus has and will remain a formidable clinical and public health problem for years to come.},

The storage periods up to which living treponemes could be detected in the testes of the inoculated rabbits as well as those storage periods up to which seroconversion occurred are related to the number of treponemes present in the treponeme‐blood mixtures. Increasing numbers of treponemes present in the donor blood resulted in longer periods up to which positive results in both parameters were found. All available evidence suggests that the upper limit of seroconversion coincides with the upper limit of treponemal survival. Inoculation with 5times104 treponemes per ml of donor blood resulted in a treponemal survival time of 48 h, inoculation with 1.25times106 treponemes per ml in a treponemal survival time of 72 h and inoculation with 2.5times107 treponemes per ml donor blood in a survival time of 120 h. {\textcopyright} 1985 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

abstract = {Background: Every year, millions of people are exposed to avoidable, life-threatening risks through the transfusion of unsafe blood. Aim: To determine the survival time of Treponema pallidum in banked donor blood. Material and Methods: Two groups of male Wistar rats (group A and B) were inoculated intratesticularly with 0.5ml of artificially infected donor blood (final density of Nichols treponemes: 5×105/ml) stored at 4°C for various periods of time. In group A, a pair each of the rats was injected every 12 hours, starting at 0 hr, up to a maximal storage time of 96 hr. In group B, the rats were injected after 72, 120, 192 and 336 hours of storage of the treponemes-blood mixture. Group C which is a control group was injected with blood only, while group D rats were injected with heat-killed treponemes suspended in blood every 12 hours. The detection of Treponema pallidum IgG/IgM was based on the principle of double antigen sandwich immunoassay, in which purified recombinant antigens are employed sufficiently to identify antibodies to Syphilis. The outcomes of interest included the proportion of Syphilis positive rats and the maximal survival hours of T. pallidum in banked blood. Results: 14 rats (77.8{\%}) out of the 18 rats that were involved in group A developed orchitis and positive serology up to 72 hours of storage time, p{\textless}0.05. 2 rats (25{\%}) in group B developed orchitis after 72hrs of storage time. All the 18 rats (100{\%}) in the control group C and D showed neither clinical nor serological changes. Conclusion: It was concluded that the survival time of T. pallidum in banked donor blood lies between 72-120hrs in this study. Regardless of blood banking temperature, T. pallidum and other transfusion transmissible infections should be screened for prior to allogeneic transfusion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Babesia microti causes transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB); currently, blood donor screening assays are unlicensed but used investigationally.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a decision tree model assessing the comparative- and cost-effectiveness of B. microti blood donation screening strategies in endemic areas compared to the status quo (question regarding a history of babesiosis), including testing by: 1) universal antibody (Ab), 2) universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 3) universal Ab/PCR, and 4) recipient risk-targeted Ab/PCR. The model predicted the number of TTB cases, complicated TTB cases, cases averted, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Economic outcomes included each strategy's per-donation cost, waste (number of infection-free units incorrectly discarded), and waste index (number wasted units/number true positives). Sensitivity analyses examined uncertainty in transmission probabilities, prevalence rates, and other key model inputs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Universal PCR in four endemic states would prevent 24 to 31 TTB cases/100,000 units transfused (pht) at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of {\$}26,000 to {\$}44,000/QALY (transmission probability dependent) and waste index of zero. Universal Ab/PCR would prevent 33 to 42 TTB cases pht at an ICER of {\$}54,000 to {\$}83,000/QALY and waste index of 0.05. The questionnaire is most wasteful (99.62 units wasted pht; 208.62 waste index), followed by the risk-targeted strategy (76.27 units wasted pht; 0.68 waste index). The model predicted zero cases of TTB or complicated TTB with universal Ab/PCR (versus [33, 42] and [13, 18] pht, respectively [no screening]). Results are highly sensitive to transmission probabilities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Universal PCR in endemic states is an effective blood donation screening strategy at a threshold of {\$}50,000/QALY. Using a higher cost-effectiveness ratio, universal Ab/PCR is the most effective strategy.},

abstract = {Background West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically-acquired arboviral disease in the United States. Several WNV vaccines are in various stages of development. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of WNV vaccination programs targeting groups at increased risk for severe WNV disease. Methods We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health outcomes of vaccination with WNV vaccine compared to no vaccination among seven cohorts, spaced at 10 year intervals from ages 10 to 70 years, each followed until 90-years-old. U.S. surveillance data were used to estimate WNV neuroinvasive disease incidence. Data for WNV seroprevalence, acute and long-term care costs of WNV disease patients, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and vaccine characteristics were obtained from published reports. We assumed vaccine efficacy to either last lifelong or for 10 years with booster doses given every 10 years. Results There was a statistically significant difference in cost-effectiveness ratios across cohorts in both models and all outcomes assessed (Kruskal-Wallis test p {\textless} 0.0001). The 60-year-cohort had a mean cost per neuroinvasive disease case prevented of {\$}664,000 and disability averted of {\$}1,421,000 in lifelong model and {\$}882,000 and {\$}1,887,000, respectively in 10-year immunity model; these costs were statistically significantly lower than costs for other cohorts (p {\textless} 0.0001). Vaccinating 70-year-olds had the lowest cost per death averted in both models at around {\$}4.7 million (95{\%}CI {\$}2–{\$}8 million). Cost per disease case averted was lowest among 40- and 50-year-old cohorts and cost per QALY saved lowest among 60-year cohorts in lifelong immunity model. The models were most sensitive to disease incidence, vaccine cost, and proportion of persons developing disease among infected. Conclusions Age-based WNV vaccination program targeting those at higher risk for severe disease is more cost-effective than universal vaccination. Annual variation in WNV disease incidence, QALY weights, and vaccine costs impact the cost effectiveness ratios.},

Because of the potential broad-spectrum risk reduction capability of PRT, the health economics of PRT could be an important consideration in decision making for this technology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Decision analytic models comparing current blood safety screens and interventions to riboflavin-based whole blood PRT (currently in development) and separately to platelets (PLTs)-and-plasma PRT from the health care system perspective in Canada were used to assess the cost-utility of PRT in reducing the following adverse events: human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus, syphilis, West Nile virus, bacteria, Chikungunya virus, cytomegalovirus, Trypanosoma cruzi, graft-versus-host disease, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, and transfusion-related immunomodulation. PRT was modeled as an addition to rather than a replacement for current interventions. The potential of PRT to reduce the risk of an unknown pathogen was not assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Whole blood PRT was estimated to have a cost-effectiveness of {\$}1,276,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] approximation, 600,000-3,313,000) compared to current screens and interventions.

abstract = {Since the 1970s, introduction of serological assays targeting virus-specific antibodies and antigens has been effective in identifying blood donations infected with the classic transfusion-transmitted infectious agents (TTIs; hepatitis B virus [HBV], HIV, human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II, hepatitis C virus [HCV]). Subsequently, progressive implementation of nucleic acid–amplification technology (NAT) screening for HIV, HCV, and HBV has reduced the residual risk of infectious-window-period donations, such that per unit risks are {\textless}1 in 1 000 000 in the United States, other high-income countries, and in high-incidence regions performing NAT. NAT screening has emerged as the preferred option for detection of newer TTIs including West Nile virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), and Babesia microti. Although there is continual need to monitor current risks due to established TTI, ongoing challenges in blood safety relate primarily to surveillance for emerging agents coupled with development of rapid response mechanisms when such agents are identified. Recent progress in development and implementation of pathogen-reduction technologies (PRTs) provide the opportunity for proactive rather than reactive response to blood-safety threats. Risk-based decision-making tools and cost-effectiveness models have proved useful to quantify infectious risks and place new interventions in context. However, as evidenced by the 2015 to 2017 ZIKV pandemic, a level of tolerable risk has yet to be defined in such a way that conflicting factors (eg, theoretical recipient risk, blood availability, cost, and commercial interests) can be reconciled. A unified approach to TTIs is needed, whereby novel tests and PRTs replace, rather than add to, existing interventions, thereby ameliorating cost and logistical burden to blood centers and hospitals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Donors are deferred for multiple reasons. Losses related to disease marker rates are well established. Donor and donation losses for other reasons, however, have not been extensively quantified. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To quantify these losses, three data sets from the Blood Centers of the Pacific were combined, permitting detailed analysis of year 2000 allogeneic whole-blood donations. RESULTS: During 2000, 13.6 percent of 116,165 persons who presented for donation were deferred at presentation. Short-term deferral accounted for 68.5 percent (hematocrit was most common at 60{\%}); long-term deferral accounted for 21 percent (travel to a malarial area and tattoo or other nonintravenous drug use needle exposure were most common at 59 and 29{\%}, respectively); and multiple-year or permanent deferral accounted for 10.5 percent (UK travel [variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] risk and emigration from a malarial area were most common at 38 and 11{\%}, respectively). Disease-marker-reactive donations represented 0.9 percent of donor outcomes. The prevalence of deferral and also miscollection (under- and overweight units) varied by age, sex, and first-time versus repeat donor status. Overall, miscollection led to a loss of 3.8 percent of 100,141 collections, ranging from 1.9 percent in repeat male donors 40 to 54 years of age to 10.7 percent in first-time female donors 16 to 24 years of age. CONCLUSION: Loss of units from both first-time and repeat donors due to temporary deferral and loss of units from miscollection are more common events than losses due to disease marker testing. Some of these losses may be avoidable and could increase the blood supply without having to recruit new donors.},

In this article, the authors start by reviewing key concepts in health economics and economic analysis methods. Examples are drawn from published blood safety studies. After explaining the underlying reasoning behind cost-effectiveness analysis, the authors point out how economic thinking is evident in some aspects of transfusion medicine. Some cost-effectiveness study results for blood safety are discussed to provide context, followed by consideration of prominent decisions that have been made in transfusion medicine field. In the last section, the authors conjecture as to why in some cases cost-effectiveness analysis appears to have greater impact than in others, noting the terrible price that is paid in mortality and morbidity when cost-effectiveness analysis is ignored. In this context, the implications of opportunity cost are discussed, and it is noted that opportunity cost should not be viewed as benefits forgone by concentrating on one aspect of blood safety and instead should be viewed as our societal willingness to misallocate resources to achieve less health for the same cost.},

abstract = {An estimated 2 million inhabitants are infected with Chagas disease in Mexico, with highest prevalence coinciding with highest demographic density in the southern half of the country. After vector-borne transmission, Trypanosoma cruzi is principally transmitted to humans via blood transfusion. Despite initiation of serological screening of blood donations or donors for T. cruzi since 1990 in most Latin American countries, Mexico only finally included mandatory serological screening nationwide in official Norms in 2012. Most recent regulatory changes and segmented blood services in Mexico may affect compliance of mandatory screening guidelines. The objective of this study was to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for total compliance of current guidelines from both Mexican primary healthcare and regular salaried worker health service institutions: the Secretary of Health and the Mexican Institute for Social Security. We developed a bi-modular model to analyze compliance using a decision tree for the most common screening algorithms for each health institution, and a Markov transition model for the natural history of illness and care. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio based on life-years gained is US{\$} 383 for the Secretary of Health, while the cost for an additional life-year gained is US{\$} 463 for the Social Security Institute. The results of the present study suggest that due to incomplete compliance of Mexico's national legislation during 2013 and 2014, the MoH has failed to confirm 15,162 T. cruzi infections, has not prevented 2,347 avoidable infections, and has lost 333,483 life-years. Although there is a vast difference in T. cruzi prevalence between Bolivia and Mexico, Bolivia established mandatory blood screening for T.cruzi in 1996 and until 2002 detected and discarded 11,489 T. cruzi -infected blood units and prevented 2,879 potential infections with their transfusion blood screening program. In the first two years of Mexico's mandated program, the two primary institutions failed to prevent due to incomplete compliance more potential infections than those gained from the first five years of Bolivia's program. Full regulatory compliance should be clearly understood as mandatory for the sake of blood security, and its monitoring and analysis in Mexico should be part of the health authority's responsibility.},

Ellingson, Mathew R.P. Sapiano, Kathryn A. Haass, Alexandra A. Savinkina, Misha L. Baker, Richard A. Henry, James J. Berger, Matthew J. Kuehnert, Sridhar V. Basavaraju BACKGROUND In August 2016, the Food and Drug Administration advised US blood centers to screen all whole blood and apheresis donations for Zika virus (ZIKV) with an individual-donor nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) or to use approved pathogen reduction technology (PRT). The cost of implementing this guidance nationally has not been assessed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Scenarios were constructed to characterize approaches to ZIKV screening, including universal ID-NAT, risk-based seasonal allowance of minipool (MP) NAT by state, and universal MP-NAT. Data from the 2015 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) were used to characterize the number of donations nationally and by state. For each scenario, the estimated cost per donor ({\$}3-{\$}9 for MP-NAT, {\$}7-{\$}13 for ID-NAT) was multiplied by the estimated number of relevant donations from the NBCUS. Cost of PRT was calculated by multiplying the cost per unit ({\$}50-{\$}125) by the number of units approved for PRT. Prediction intervals for costs were generated using Monte Carlo simulation methods. RESULTS Screening all donations in the 50 states and DC for ZIKV by ID-NAT would cost {\$}137 million (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], {\$}109-{\$}167) annually. Allowing seasonal MP-NAT in states with lower ZIKV risk could reduce NAT screening costs by 18{\%} to 25{\%}. Application of PRT to all platelet (PLT) and plasma units would cost {\$}213 million (95{\%} CI, {\$}156-{\$}304). CONCLUSION Universal ID-NAT screening for ZIKV will cost US blood centers more than {\$}100 million annually. The high cost of PRT for apheresis PLTs and plasma could be mitigated if, once validated, testing for transfusion transmissible pathogens could be eliminated.

Although serum from some patients had IgM antibody against dengue virus, the illness seemed clinically distinct from previously detected dengue. Subsequent testing with the use of consensus primers detected Zika virus RNA in the serum of the patients but no dengue virus or other arboviral RNA. No previous outbreaks and only 14 cases of Zika virus disease have been previously documented. Methods We obtained serum samples from patients and interviewed patients for information on clinical signs and symptoms. Zika virus disease was confirmed by a finding of Zika virus RNA or a specific neutralizing antibody response to Zika virus in the serum. Patients with IgM antibody against Zika virus who had a potentially cross-reactive neutralizing-antibody response were classified as having probable Zika virus disease. We conducted a household survey to estimate the proportion of Yap resid...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The spread of West Nile virus across North America and evidence of transmission by transfusion prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to encourage the development of methods to screen the blood supply. OBJECTIVE To assess the cost-effectiveness of nucleic acid amplification testing for West Nile virus in the U.S. blood supply. DESIGN Markov cohort simulation. DATA SOURCES Outcome probabilities estimated from nucleic acid testing done for West Nile virus in 2003, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and published literature. Costs were taken from an economic study of West Nile virus infection and from estimated test costs. TARGET POPULATIONS: Transfusion recipients, 60 years of age or older, with and without underlying immunocompromise. TIME HORIZON Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE Societal. INTERVENTIONS The authors compared 6 strategies, taking into consideration minipool (pools of 6 to 16 donations) versus individual donation testing, and the geographic and seasonal nature of West Nile virus activity. OUTCOME MEASURES Costs and effects of each strategy based on the prevention of transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS The cost-effectiveness of annual, national minipool testing was 483,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), whereas the cost-effectiveness of annual, national individual donation testing was 897,000 dollars/QALY. The cost-effectiveness of targeted individual donation testing in an area experiencing an outbreak coupled with minipool testing elsewhere was 520,000 dollars/QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS In 1-way analyses, the most important influences were the prevalence of West Nile virus and the cost of minipool testing and individual donation testing. The 95{\%} range of results from probabilistic sensitivity analysis for targeted individual donation testing was 256,000 dollars to 1,044,000 dollars/QALY. LIMITATIONS The outcomes of West Nile virus infection were based on data from the general population rather than from the population who received transfusions. The results are most useful in the context of geographically focused outbreaks of West Nile virus infection. CONCLUSIONS Using targeted individual donation testing to interdict blood donations that are positive for the West Nile virus is relatively cost-effective but is highly dependent on West Nile virus prevalence.},
